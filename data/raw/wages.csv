Methodological notes: ,,,,
Seasonal adjustment by direct method, i.e. separately for individual variables, using the TRAMO/SEATS procedure as part of the JDEMETRA+ package. Seasonal adjustment consists in ,,
elimination of the seasonal effect (annual, regular deviations trend, observed in annual cycle), and in case of series which may be influenced by calendar and working days effect ,
(effects resulting from calendar layout and variability of the number of working days not having a seasonal effect) - elimination also those effects.,,,,
